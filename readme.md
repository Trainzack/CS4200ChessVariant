## Introduction

This project attempts to create novel variants of the strategy board game Chess using a genetic evolutionary algorithm. It certainly produces *something*.

This project was made in the pursuit of passing our AI class, and was not designed for public release. Therefore, it has no user interface, inadequate documentation, and absolutely *no* warranty of any kind. Use this software at your own risk.

## Dependencies

* Pyffish (see https://pypi.org/project/pyffish/)
* fairy-stockfish_x86-64.exe must be placed in the root directory of the project (See https://github.com/ianfab/Fairy-Stockfish/)
* You have to run it on Windows (or ReactOS I guess) because of the executable.
